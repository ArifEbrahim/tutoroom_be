# Enable the Rails rules included in the rubocop-rails gem.

# Exclusions
# ==========
#
# Rails has powerful generators.
#
# Some auto-generated files are edited frequently. We want to lint them,
# so let's avoid adding them to this list.
# e.g. controllers, models, views
#
# Other auto-generated files are usually not edited afterwards.
# There's almost zero value in linting them, so let's exclude them.
# e.g. binstubs, config, migrations
